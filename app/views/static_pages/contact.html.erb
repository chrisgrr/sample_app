<h1>Contact Us</h1>
<p>
  If you'd like to contact us then there should really be some kind of interactive form here really. Oh well, shame there isn't
</p>

<p>
  But if you'd really like, you can contact Ruby on Rails Tutorial about the sample app at the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/contact">contact page</a>
